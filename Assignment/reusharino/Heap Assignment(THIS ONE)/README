ISSUES

The primary issues encountered in this project have been comprehension of
the pyxel module, the implementation of heaps has not been a major issue as illustrated
by the minHeap.py and maxHeap.py files. The primary issue has been the actual animation
of the processes performed by the files previously mentioned. This may just be a human
error issue.
