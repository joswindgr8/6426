- A paragraph documenting issues you encountered in the design or implementation of your chosen data structure/algorithm.

- Briefly explain the strengths and weaknesses of your data structure or algorithm with respect to resource consumption. Under what conditions does it perform the best or worst?

- List a real-world application of your chosen data structure or algorithm.
/br any data base can use binary search to look for an item as long as the data base is sorted.
- A sentence or two on the asymptotic worst-case time and space complexity of your chosen data structure/algorithm.
since I implemented the binary search with recurion, the worst-case time and space complexity should be O(log n), else if the the binary search is implemented with iteration is O(1)
